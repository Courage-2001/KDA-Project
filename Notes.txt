IMPORTANT:
    Since installing library, we must set up the enviroment on every new solution we create for a c++ project using wxWidgets.
    Steps to take:
        1) Make sure cpp file exist in order to edit properties of solution
        2) right click on solution and go to properties
        3) make sure config -> all configs and platform -> all platforms at the top
        4) go to settings for C/C++, and add additional include directories. They are $(WXWIN)\include & $(WXWIN)\include\msvc
        5) expand linker settings and click on system. change subsystem -> windows subsystem and click apply
        6) set platform to Win32, goto general in linker and for additional lib dir, write $(WXWIN)\lib\vc_lib
        7) set platform to x64 and for additional lib dir, write $(WXWIN)\lib\vc_x64_lib and then click apply

ID's being used:
    - ID's 2-16 are being used for Listboxes (orders) and Button (tables)
    - ID 27 is used to instantiate all dialog control on event
    - ID 50 is used to instantiate spin control on event
    - ID 40-43 are used on generated choice box(es) when selecting category of food for customer orders
    - ID 26 is used for the confirm button that is generated to confirm selection of orders
    - ID's 45-48 are used to represent listBoxes tied to the ID's of the generated choice boxes (ID + 5)


TO DO:
    1) Add functionality to AddNumberOfPatrons(), recieving input and returning it to EndModal() and updating container with data
    2) Figure out a way to create a menu that user can set dishes patrons ordered (listBox or a choiceBox)
    3) Have said orders be in the container, and retrieve anytime we swtich screens 
    4) Display orders properly in second screen full of listBoxes
    4) Change colors of table during phases of dining (green for present, orange for waiting, red for done, black when empty)
    5) Have a working csv (read and write) when it comes to tracking popular dishes, amount of customers per day, etc.
    6) Polish the UI (Never!)
