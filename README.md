## KITCHEN DISPLAY APP (WIP)
- Hobby project of mine to create something of this scale on my own to sharpen my c++ skills, as well as a personal vendetta of a specific restaurant >:)
  - GUI all done using the framework wxWidgets
- This GUI app aims to contain the following functionality as a baseline:
   - Have the user set how many patrons are being sat at a table
   - Have the user set each patrons order, from a selection of food varieties (as well as any conflicts i.e. no salt, or allergies that must be stated)
   - Let the kitchen staff on a second window confirm or deny that the dishes of said table has been sent out
   - Clear the table of all patrons, returning to it's default state
 - On top of the user experience, I also aim to create a logistics menu that can be accessed by an admin and display any data that is relevant (such as amount of dishes ordered in a month, which dishes were the most popular, etc.)
   - All data will be stored in documents, rather than a traditional database (just because i want to. it's far simpler to set up a live database, but i want the challenge of managing documents, parsing data, and proper read and write)
